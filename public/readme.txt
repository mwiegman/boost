*I know these passwords are insecure, just wanted to make them easy to remember :-)

Features I need to implement in the site include a password reset/forgot feature. I would also like to add a WYSIWYG editor in text areas and online payment processing. Another feature I would like would be the ability to register multiple students at one time, but I could not figure out how to do this reliably for this phase. I'd also like to look into offering different login options, such as signing in with Google, Facebook, or Amazon.
